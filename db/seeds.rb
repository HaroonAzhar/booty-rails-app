# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
# 	apple_inc=Supplier.create(name: "apple corp")
# 	sony=Supplier.create(name: "sony")
#   ps4= Item.create(name: "ps4",description:"dfdfs",company:sony,year:2015,price:50000)
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
